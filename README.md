  Matter Supply Coding Challenge - MSCo. Blog SPA

## ðŸš€ Quick start

First of all, let me start out by saying thank you for giving me the extra time to complete this, and it pains me to have to say this, but I owe you much more documentation than I'm giving you right now. I've been focusing on just getting this up and running and have now run out of time, so I need to go back and put together some coherent docs that explains clearly how I put this all together. For now, we can get you up and runing so you can at least start checking it out...

1.  **Clone the repo.**

    Go to the repo on my github account and clone the repo I've been working on, here:

    ```shell
    #clone using this command in your terminal
    git clone git@github.com:davechurilla/MSCoBlogChallenge.git
    ```

1.  **Install with NPM using the `npm install` command**

    `cd` into the directory you just cloned and use `npm install` for dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd MSCoBlogChallenge/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Run the app locally**

    If you have Gatsby installed globally, you can use the `gatsby develop` command.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying the data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

You should be able to get into the admin to add posts using OAuth with your GitHub account info. Other than that, there are a few posts set up already to check out. I did NOT have time to work on animations and page transitions for this... I do remember that heavily emphasized that portion of it as being heavily weighted, so I do aplogize about that (to myself, mostly). Also, the search fucntionality is missing, and the blog post page still is just taking on the plain vanilla styles of Netlify out of the box. I needed to put more ficus on other areas of the app in the interesst of time.

You should know that as you make new posts, you will need to pull down from the repo to get the latest from the repo as all updates to the blog posts are deplyed through Netlify from Github. Hopefully to won't have any trouble gaining access. Let me know if you do. You can also go to the deployed live build that is hosted on Netlify, here to check out your updates:
https://laughing-pare-85fb34.netlify.app/

It does take a while to update re-deploy changes though. Again, let me know if you need to me to trigger a deploy and I can do that.

Look forward to hearing your feedback! I will update this documentation as soon as I can.

Thanks,
 - Dave Churilla
