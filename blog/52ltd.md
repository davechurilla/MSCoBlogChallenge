<h3>Save time, money, or frustration. 
Pick three.</h3>

52 Limited is a digital staffing agency. We connect marketing and engineering departments, brands, start-ups, design firms, advertising and interactive agencies with world-class creative and technology talent.

We unequivocally support diversity and equity hiring practices and this commitment is reflected in our talent pools, which we're proud to say reach deeper and far wider than would be possible without such a longstanding inclusive approach.

We represent a strong and ever-growing pool of talented design, technology, marketing, and advertising professionals ready to fill your contract, contract-to-hire, and permanent staffing needs. Whether you’re looking for individual freelancers, full-time employees, or entire project teams, we can help. We handle all the legwork and—for employees placed on contract assignment—we manage payroll, benefits, taxes and carry liability insurance. Which means you’re free to concentrate on what you do best.
