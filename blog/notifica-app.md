Use Notifica to plan, learn and act if you are at risk of being detained by deportation agents.

**Why use Notifica?**

Notify your Deportation Defense Network all at once
By pressing one button, Notifica will send your alert simultaneously to people you trust and community groups who can support you.

Include your last known location with your alert
By sharing your location you’re making it easier for your Defense Network to defend you. Notifica will access your location data only when you send an alert.

**Keep your data secure**

Notifica clears all the app data when you send an alert and uses some of the strongest encryption available to keep your data private.

Send intro texts and resources for your Defense Network, check your preparedness level and know your rights—all within the app!
